## Standard crackme challenge 
This challenge involves the user to start with basic reverse engineering and looking at the binary in ghidra/IDA to identify the flow of of the progrmm and understand the logic used to derive the key.

1. The program takes an input and searches for the value in an array and returns the index.
2. This index is further compared against another array to be in order.
3. So derive the key just copy the two array remove the null bytes and do a refferencing operating.

```
for i in list_of_indexes:
	flag += chr(list_of_values[i])

print(flag)
```
